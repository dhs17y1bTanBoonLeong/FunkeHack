# FunkeHack
Team SUSI Funke Hackathon

## 1. Challenge
The process to create and develop skills on different platform is cumbersome. Testing skills on different platforms takes time.

## 2. Goal
Develop a concept and prototype for developers and marketers to easily create skills and test them. This can shorten nights to test skills on platforms. It is also possible to quickly create skills and showcase them to possible customers.

## 3. Prototype Idea
* Users can add their skill code to an Etherpad and activate it on any platform by using a hotword. 
* We call this concept a dream. So, users can activate their skill by calling "dream [name of the pad]"
* The user can deploy "dreams" and ask anyone to test dreams.

## 4. Implementation
We implemented this with SUSI.AI and set up an Etherpad on dream.susi.ai. 

We added the hotword "dream" to SUSI. The Etherpad installation provides a simply API

## 5. Example
a) Create your skill pad and add your test skills: URL: http://dream.susi.ai/p/funkehackathon

b) Go to http://chat.susi.ai

c) Activate your skill pad with "dream FunkeHackathon"

d) Test your skill

e) Share the pad with co-developers to collaborate on the skill creation

f) Share the pad name with testers and get feedback

### What skills work already

We will add a basic skill tutorial here.

## 8. Opportunities
* Free and Open Source Skills for free
* Closed Skills for paid

## 6. Who we are
* Hong Phuc, developer community/business development
* Mario Behling, front-end developer
* Michael Christen, search engine developer and back-end

## 7. Next steps
* Integrate with API.ai
* Integrate accounting system and enable users to limit access to their pads. This could also be a pro-feature.
* Connect solutions with Alexa, Google, Cortana, Siri e.g. "SUSI dream"
