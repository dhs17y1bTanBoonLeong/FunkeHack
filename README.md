Team SUSI Funke Hackathon

## 1. Challenge for Customers: Expensive Development Process to Create Skills for Different Platforms
The process to create and develop skills on different platform is cumbersome. Testing skills on all platforms takes up a lot of time of highly paid developers. All companies need to make the switch from the Visual Only Web to the Conversational Web need skills and want to keep the cost low. 

## 2. Solution: The SUSI Dream
The SUSI Dream is a solution to shorten the time of the development process and enable developers and marketers to quickly create and test skills.

Our solution shortens long nights to develop and test skills on different platforms. It even makes it possible to quickly create skills and showcase them to possible customers on the spot. It is a perfect platform for web agencies that want to sell their services.

## 3. Working Prototype
* Users can add their skill code to an integrated coding editor pad and activate it on any platform by using a hotword. 
* We call this concept a dream. So, users can activate their skill by calling "dream [name of the pad]"
* The user can deploy "dreams" and ask anyone to test dreams.
* Example: We implemented this with SUSI.AI and set up an Etherpad on dream.susi.ai using the hotword "dream".

## 4. Life Example
a) Create your skill pad and add your test skills: URL: http://dream.susi.ai/p/funkehackathon

b) Go to http://chat.susi.ai

c) Activate your skill pad with "dream FunkeHackathon"

d) Test your skill

e) Share the pad with co-developers to collaborate on the skill creation

f) Share the pad name with testers and get feedback

## 5. Business Opportunities

## 6. How do we get Customers
* We will reach out to developers through our network and present it at conference
* Use Social Media to push the solution
* Platform is based on Open Source and has a lot of potential to engage developers
* We have a large developer network as founders of FOSSASIA
* Participating in Google Summer of Code and Google Code-In where we can push the platform

## 6. Who are our Competitors
