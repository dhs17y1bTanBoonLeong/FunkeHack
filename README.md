# FunkeHack
Team SUSI Funke Hackathon

## 1. Challenge
The process to create and develop skills on different platform can be cumbersome.

## 2. Goal
Develop a concept and prototype to easily create skills and test them.

## 3. Idea
Users can add their skill code to an Etherpad and activate it on any platform by using a hotword. We call this concept a dream. So, users can activate their skill by calling "dream [name of the pad]" The user can deploy "dreams" and ask anyone to test dreams.

## 4. Implementation
We implemented this with SUSI.AI and set up an Etherpad on dream.susi.ai. We added the hotword "dream" to SUSI. The Etherpad installation provides a simply API

## 5. Next steps
Integrate accounting system and enable users to limit access to their pads. This could also be a pro-feature.

## 6. Example
a) Create your skill pad and add your test skills: URL: http://dream.susi.ai/p/funkehackathon

b) Go to http://chat.susi.ai

c) Activate your skill pad with "dream FunkeHackathon"

d) Test your skill

e) Share the pad with co-developers to collaborate on the skill creation

f) Share the pad name with testers and get feedback
