Team SUSI Funke Hackathon

## 1. Challenge: Expensive Development Process to Create Skills for Different Platforms
The process to create and develop skills on different platform is cumbersome. Testing skills on different platforms takes up a lot of time of highly paid developers.

## 2. Solution: The SUSI Dream
An application for developers and marketers to easily create skills and test them. This shortens long nights to test skills on platforms. It even makes it possible to quickly create skills and showcase them to possible customers. It is a perfect platform for agencies that want to sell their services.

## 3. Working Prototype
* Users can add their skill code to an integrated coding editor pad and activate it on any platform by using a hotword. 
* We call this concept a dream. So, users can activate their skill by calling "dream [name of the pad]"
* The user can deploy "dreams" and ask anyone to test dreams.
* Example: We implemented this with SUSI.AI and set up an Etherpad on dream.susi.ai using the hotword "dream".

## 4. Life Example
a) Create your skill pad and add your test skills: URL: http://dream.susi.ai/p/funkehackathon

b) Go to http://chat.susi.ai

c) Activate your skill pad with "dream FunkeHackathon"

d) Test your skill

e) Share the pad with co-developers to collaborate on the skill creation

f) Share the pad name with testers and get feedback

## 6. Opportunities
* Free and Open Source Skills for free
* Closed Skills for paid
* Platform is based on Open Source and has a lot of potential to engage developers
* We are participating in Google Summer of Code and Google Code-In where we can push the platform

## 7. Competitors
* Say Spring
* Alexa, Google, Siri as platforms itself

## 6. Who we are
* Hong Phuc, developer community/business development
* Mario Behling, front-end developer, serial techpreneur
* Michael Christen, search engine developer and back-end

## 7. Next steps
1. Business Development + Funding
2. Technology Development
* Integrate with API.ai
* Integrate accounting system and enable users to limit access to their pads. This could also be a pro-feature.
* Connect solutions with Alexa, Google, Cortana, Siri e.g. "SUSI dream"
