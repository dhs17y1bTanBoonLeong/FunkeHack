# FunkeHack
Team SUSI Funke Hackathon

## 1. Challenge for Customers: Expensive Development Process to Create Skills for Different Platforms
The process to create and develop skills on different platform is cumbersome. 

Testing skills on all platforms takes up a lot of time. Developer times means money. We had this challenge here at the event.
 

## 2. Solution: The SUSI Dream
What we did over the weekend we implemented a test environment for an existing Open Source AI, which is SUSI.AI. 

We want to enable developers and marketers to quickly create and test skills.

Let's take a look at the working prototype

## 3. Working Prototype

What can skill developers do here?
* First: They can add their skill code directly into an integrated code editor pad
* Second developers can activate the pad on the platform by using a hotword. 
* We call this concept a "dream". So, users can activate their skill by calling "dream" and the "[name of the pad]"
* The advantage: The developer can deploy "dreams" super easy immediately and ask anyone to test dreams by using the hotword.

For this hackathon we created the dream "Funke". So, we will show you now how the AI works normally and what works when the dream is enabled.

## 5. Business Opportunities
What are the business opportunities?
We will offer Freely lisensed skills for free.
Closed source skills with locked coding editors are a pro-feature.

## 6. How do we get Customers
* We will reach out to developers through our network, present it at conferences and use social media
* Our Platform is based on Open Source and therefore has a lot of potential to engage developers
* We have a large developer network as founders of FOSSASIA and we are participating in Google Summer of Code and Google Code-In where we can push the platform

## 7. Who are our Competitors
* sayspring.com
* Alexa, Google, Siri as platforms itself

## 8. Who we are
* Hong Phuc, developer community/business development
* Mario Behling, front-end developer, serial techpreneur
* Michael Christen, search engine developer and back-end

## 9. Next steps
1. Business Development + Funding
2. Technology Development
* Integrate with Natural Language Processing
* Integrate accounting system and enable users to limit access to their pads. This could also be a pro-feature.
* Connect solutions with Alexa, Google, Cortana, Siri e.g. "SUSI dream"
